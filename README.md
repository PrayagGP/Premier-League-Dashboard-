## Introduction
This project involves web scraping Premier League data from various websites and predicting outcomes using machine learning models. The data is then visualized in a dashboard.

## Project Structure

### FinalDataset.xlsx
This sheet contains all the web scraped as well as calculated data which was used for final predictions and visualization.

### Final_Model.ipynb
This notebook contains the code used for web scraping data from different websites and then using the data from predicting the final standings as well as the goals scored for and against the team.

### Final_Submission.pbix
This Power BI file contains the final dashboard where all the data is visualized in the form of tables and charts. It provides insights and key metrics derived from the data.
